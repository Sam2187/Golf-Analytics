#Tutorial


#First we import the packages needed
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd


#We now define the url we are going to be using
url = 'http://www.owgr.com/en/Ranking.aspx?pageNo=1&pageSize=300&country=All'


#We then need to initiante the http request to url
res = requests.get(url)


#Here we use beautifulsoup to scrape the data
soup = BeautifulSoup(res.content, 'lxml')


#Now we find the first table element on the page, this can be changed according
#to the html tag we need
table = soup.find('table')


#We then initiate a blank list and a counter for ranking position
rankings = []
curr_rank = 1


#We then use a for loop to iterate over all rows in the table, starting with
#the second row to get the top 100 golfers
for rows in table.find_all('tr')[1:101]: 
  
  
#Now we create a variable for the for loop to store the data in
player = {}


#We then assign the name, country, and rank for each player we need in our
#table
player['name'] = rows.find('td',{'class':'name'}).text
player['country'] = rows.find('td',{'class':'ctry'}).find('img')['title']
player['rank'] = curr_rank
curr_rank += 1


#Then we append each player to the ranking list
rankings.append(player)


#Finally we create a dataframe with ranking as index
df = pd.DataFrame(rankings).set_index('rank')
df.to_csv('./current-top100.csv')
